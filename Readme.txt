SIPPER can be used to automatically detect and quantify partially labeled C13 peptides.  
Automatically extracts information for all peptides in a single dataset using a list of expected peptides.  
Includes a GUI for manual visualization and annotation of detected LC-MS features. 
Also includes a Simple MS Viewer for exploring mass spectral data.  
Supports Thermo .Raw files, plus also mzXML, mzML, and mz5.

In order to read Thermo .raw files, you must install the Thermo MSFileReader v2.2 from
http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703
When the installer offers you the option of the version to install, be sure to install the 32-bit version.
You can also install the 64-bit version, though SIPPER only uses the 32-bit DLLs.
